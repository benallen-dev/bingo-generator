# Bingo Generator

One day my girlfriend came up to me and asked "If I have a list of songs, can you make bingo cards?". The answer is this program.

## Please note

This was never meant to be more than a one-off program just for this event, but I believe in building in public and sharing even the jankiest of code, so I leave it here in the hope that it be useful to you.

It's not easily configurable, nor very user friendly, and it could really use refactoring but it's not really worth the effort if you ask me.


## Fun fact
If your cards contain 9 songs and your list is 33 songs long, you can create 38.567.099 unique bingo cards. Learn more about [combinations at Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination).
